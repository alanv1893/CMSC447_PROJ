All the pages are stored under Frontend/src/views  (This is what the web pages are)

For the add or review items its functinality in the end will need to include 
-Uploading an .xlsx to add supplier orders that are recived 
-Automated way to upate and change stock in general 

**We could call these 'recive order' and 'audit inventory'
-They should have a warning message if thats ok about the implications of what they are gonna do
