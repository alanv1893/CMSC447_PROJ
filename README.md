INFORMATION About the FROnt End Building 

All the pages are stored under Frontend/src/views  (This is what the web pages are)
to make them connect they need to be added to /router/index.js ....i think thats the only place

Must run the server that info is in backend 
to run fronend that info is in the ,txt in frontend 

Currently admin page is all we have and its called homepage

the logins is user123   and password is password 

I added some functionality like cart and approving things
*need tofix an issue where on the top up it dosent display the item name for approving 
*in the approval page click on the item to approve it works 
*rejecting does not reject ti stays on the list 

made the cart it works good

I added an outline for reports that we can start creating 

One is the traffick on a day 

The other is getting all the inventory 

The explanation is in the backend end read me 

implement those

Also the auth login needs to be in its just hard coded rn
