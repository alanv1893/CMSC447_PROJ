No not those carts, shopping carts 

Logic and database flow for frontend to backend cart creation

--User should have items and quantites stored they wanna buy first 
--Logic for Making the cart is intersting but will work 

first Call is create a cart for the user this is stored in the table 
'carts' it just has ID #, status, and will eventually have the user info 

The contents of the cart is stored in a seperate table
that table is cart_items 
It has a random primary key 
the cart identifier foreighn key 
the item 
the quantity 

to get a tranaction we must 
-return all the items in items_cart with its forieghn key 

**Remeber to update the transactione when processed and wipe the things from both tables
